Description: Provides C++ headers and callables for working with the
    'date' library. 'date' provides comprehensive support for working with
    dates and date-times, which this package exposes to make it easier for
    other R packages to utilize. Headers are provided for calendar
    specific calculations, along with a limited callable interface for
    time zone manipulations.
